# Review: Typing Rules
* Compiler allows the memory box to hold any subtype.
* Compiler allows calls based on static type.
* Overriden non-static methods are selected at runtime based on dynamic type.
* For overloaded methods, the method is selected at compile time.

## exercise 
* casting, 注意外面可以有括号  
```java
Object o2 = new ShowDog("dd",12);
ShowDog sdx = ((ShowDog)o2);
```
