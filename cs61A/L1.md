## statements and expressions
* Python code consists of expressions and statements. Broadly, computer programs consist of instructions to either
* * Compute some value - expressions 
* * Carry out some action - statements
## functions
* Functions encapsulate logic that manipulates data. urlopen is a function. 
## Objects
* An object seamlessly bundles together data and the logic that manipulates that data, in a way that manages the complexity of both.
## Interpreters
* Evaluating compound expressions requires a precise procedure that interprets code in a predictable way. A program that implements such a procedure, evaluating compound expressions, is called an interpreter.

When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language <br>
provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three <br>
such mechanisms:
* primitive expressions and statements, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
* means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
* means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
## names 
* three ways to bind names to the value 
* * the assignment statement (simplest means of **abstraction**)
