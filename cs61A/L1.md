## statements and expressions
* Python code consists of expressions and statements. Broadly, computer programs consist of instructions to either
* * Compute some value - expressions 
* * Carry out some action - statements
## functions
* Functions encapsulate logic that manipulates data. urlopen is a function. 
## Objects
* An object seamlessly bundles together data and the logic that manipulates that data, in a way that manages the complexity of both.
