# backend 
The back- end of a website consists of a **server, an application, and a database**.
In order to make the server, application, and database communicate with each other, <br>
back-end devs use **server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net** to build<br>
an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data<br>
and serve it back to the user in front-end code. 

Job openings for back-end developers often also call for **experience with PHP frameworks <br>
like Zend, Symfony, and CakePHP; experience with version control software like SVN, CVS, or Git;<br>
and experience with Linux as a development and deployment system.**

"Recently public and private APIs have become an essential part of trading data between<br>
mobile devices, websites, and other connected systems. **Creating APIs** that the public finds <br>
useful is a very satisfying part of my job"

# 学习建议
When learning, your mind will consistently switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. Focus mode occurs when you are consciously focusing on learning,<br> reading, watching videos, or working on a project. Diffuse mode occurs subconsciously, at times when you are not actively learning, such as when you’re<br>doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the<br> other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.

It’s important to know that your mind goes through these two states when learning because you can utilize this to make your learning more efficient.<br> When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a<br> solution<br> to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.

# web 前端三大核心技术
* html 网页控件
* css 美化控件代码
* JavaScript 增强表现力的脚本语言
# 学习路线
## 第1阶段
* html+css，基础中的基础
* JavaScript
梳理Js的知识结构，知道这门语言能做什么，不能做什么。<br>
记住大部分JavaScript的函数，知道如何实现，并多加练习，<br>
花大量的时间在浏览器控制台上写代码，测试if-else语句，数组，函数等。<br>

## 第2阶段
1.熟练使用javascript，jQuery,Echarts，移动端技术，javascript的面向对象<br>
2.浏览器的兼容问题，需要懂WEB标准，熟练手写xhtml，css3并符合 w3c的标准，<br>
代码能兼容主流浏览器Firfox，Chrome，Safari，IE,等，虽然IE6有多都不兼容，<br>
但现在使用的人还有的<br>
3.熟悉一门后台编程语言如：asp，php，jsp等来扩展以后工作的需求

## 第3阶段
熟练使用vue框架，node.js，React，Angular，混合式开发/原生开发<br>
vue：是一套组建用户界面的，渐进式框架，用于搭建表单繁多， <br> 
且内容需要根据用户的操作进行修改的页面版应用<br>
Node.js 是一个服务器端的，非阻断式i/o的，事件驱动的javascript运行环境，<br>  
能够使得javascript脱离浏览器运行。<br>
React是Facrbool内部的一个javascript类库，用于创建WEB用户交互界面<br>
