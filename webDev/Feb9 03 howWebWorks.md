# Clients and servers
* Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.

* Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
* Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

(analogy: clent - home; server - shop)
* Your internet connection: the road
* **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. 
* **DNS** Domain Name System is like an **address book** for websites. 
When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). 
*  **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a **language** for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.
*  **Component files** : A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
* * Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* * Assets:such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.
