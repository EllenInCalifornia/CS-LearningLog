# Summary 
### server
* The internet is a wire
* two computers connected directly to the wire can communicate
* servers: special computer connected directly to the wire/Internet
* * web pages are files stored on that server's harddrive
* every computer has an IP address, whose alias is called <br>domain name like google.com
### client 
* computers connected to the Internet indirectly through **ISP**

* **DSL**<br>数字用户线路（Digital Subscriber Line），是通过铜线或者本地电话网提供数字连接的一种技术。
 A technology for high-speed network or Internet access over voice lines

### packet
whenever data like email, picture travels across the internet, <br>
computers break this information into smaller pieces called packets,<br>
when the data reaches ite destination, the packets are reassembled in<br>
the original order. 

### IP address and router

*  IP address and router guarantees that you send your info the right destination
*  everything connected directly/ indirectly has an IP address
*  anywhere two or more parts of the Internet intersect, there is a **router**
*

* The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible.<br>
*  At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

## router
* each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a router.<br>
This router has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, <br>
it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer.<br>

* By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely.

The telephone infrastructure already connects your house with anyone in the world so it is the perfect<br>
wire we need. To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a modem.
This modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.
# (ISP)Internet Service Provider

The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach.<br>
 To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is <br>
 a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers. 
 <br>So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. <br>
 The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.

# IP address（Internet Protocol）192.168.2.10.
any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" 
<br>(where IP stands for Internet Protocol). It's an address made of a series of four numbers <br>
separated by dots, for example: 192.168.2.10.

# domain name 
* alias an IP address with a human-readable name： 
* google.com is the **domain name **used on top of the IP address 142.250.190.78.

# Internet and the web
* The Internet is an infrastructure, <br> whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure. 
* It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.
(IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a worldwide chat system requiring an Internet connection and an IRC client, <br>
which sends and receives messages via the IRC server.)

* the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. 
* ****Among those computers, some computers (called Web servers) can send messages intelligible to web browsers.**
